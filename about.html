            <h2>Vasil Iliev – The Emperor of the Bulgarian Underworld</h2>

            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Vasil Iliev was born in 1965 in the town of Kyustendil, Bulgaria. As a young man, he pursued a career in wrestling and became a respected athlete. However, after the fall of communism in Bulgaria, the country entered a period of chaos, and many former athletes turned to organized crime as a way to survive and gain power.</p>

            <h3>The Rise of VIS</h3>
            <p>In the early 1990s, Vasil Iliev founded <strong>VIS (Voinishka Industrialna Sigurnost)</strong>, an organization that started as a security and insurance company. However, VIS quickly became one of the most powerful criminal groups in Bulgaria, engaging in activities such as racketeering, smuggling, and money laundering.</p>

            <p>Under his leadership, VIS gained control over many businesses, nightclubs, and even parts of the economy. His influence extended beyond Bulgaria, and he became one of the most feared and respected figures in the Bulgarian underworld.</p>

            <h3>Clashes and Power Struggles</h3>
            <p>As Vasil Iliev’s power grew, so did his list of enemies. The Bulgarian underworld was a battlefield, with different groups fighting for dominance. One of VIS's biggest rivals was <strong>SIC (Security Insurance Company)</strong>, a competing criminal organization.</p>

            <p>Despite the violence and power struggles, Vasil Iliev was known for his charismatic leadership and ability to maintain control over his empire. Many people respected him, and he was even seen as a Robin Hood-like figure by some.</p>

            <h3>The Assassination</h3>
            <p>On <strong>April 25, 1995</strong>, Vasil Iliev was assassinated in Sofia. As he was driving his Mercedes on Todor Kableshkov Street, unknown gunmen opened fire on him. He was killed instantly. His murder remains one of the most high-profile assassinations in Bulgaria, and to this day, the case remains officially unsolved.</p>

            <p>Many theories exist about who ordered the hit. Some believe it was his rivals from SIC, while others think it was a move from within his own organization. Regardless of who was behind it, his death marked the end of an era in Bulgaria’s criminal world.</p>

            <h3>Legacy</h3>
            <p>After his death, his younger brother, <strong>Georgi Iliev</strong>, took over VIS, but he too was later assassinated in 2005. The Iliev brothers left behind a legacy of power, fear, and intrigue that is still discussed today.</p>

            <p>For some, Vasil Iliev was a dangerous criminal, while for others, he was a man who rose to power in a chaotic time and built an empire. His story remains one of the most fascinating tales in Bulgaria’s modern history.</p>
